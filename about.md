I've got a lot of hobbies.

Too many. And I wish I didn't need 8 hours of sleep to function.

I started sewing when I was in middle school. My mom made many of my Halloween costumes, dresses and scrunchies growing up. Making clothing has been my favorite creative outlet and how I express myself. I did dye my hair pink once.

Since I was little I loved science. I grew up with an appreciation for nature, and enjoy splunking around in mountains whether that is hiking or mountain biking. It is this conflict I struggle with every weekend: outside or inside hobbies today?

After graduating college, I pursued science education. Creating curriculum and activities was my strength as a teacher. This ability to create something and map out a plan is what led me to programming. I instantly loved building my personal website. I got to problem solve and add my creativity.

So at this moment of writing this, I chose to stay indoors.
